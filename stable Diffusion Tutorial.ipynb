This means that the noise added to the image would increase through timesteps. What it means? Imagine we start from a clean image, and we add noise to it, even a little bit of noise would be noticeable. But if we add noise to a noisy image, the noise added would be insignificant. As a result, with more timesteps, we also need to add more noise to make it be more inflential. This is the logic behind the definition of $a_t$."
