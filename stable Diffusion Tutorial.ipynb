    "As learners like you, when we first touch upon the state-of-art model of Stable Diffusion, we found it complicated and perplexing. Based of empirical results and combined with multiple distinct parts, the model itself is hard to appreciate and even hard to follow without a clear and logical path😖. If you feel the same way, don't worry, we were all at the same boat😤. As learners, we looked through different materials and tutorials, but we could not find something that both comprehensive enough logic-wise or coding-wise😔.\n",

From this, we know its backbone is essentially a model called diffusion. So, before we dive into the actual stable diffusion, we think it's better to learn about what is Diffusion.

    "In short, the ddpm (diffusion) model is basically a process of adding noise and denoising, which could be easliy divided into 2 seperate directions, the forward process - adding noise and the reverse process - denosing. The general idea behind this model is, if by defined, we know how to iteratively add noise to a image that let it eventually become a completely noisy image (in a sense equals to random samples), could we use some deep learning networks to learn the noise added to the model in each step?\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we could accomplish that, does it mean that we have a way to predict the added noise for each state during the process (the difference of noise level between each timestep)? Then using the noise we predicted, does it mean that we could start from a random noise, and continuing substract the noise we predicted, which at the end give us a image without noise? That is the generative result we want. \n",

    "    - $a_t$ is the noise level at timestep $t$, and it is defined by using a function $a_t = 1 - \\beta_t$ where $\\beta_t$ is a hyperparameter that increases through timesteps, which t increases $\\beta_t$ also increase. This would cause $a_t$ to decrease through timesteps.\n",
    "        - So why? Why we defined $a_t$ in this way? Observe the formula, when $a_t$ decreases through timestep, $\\sqrt{1-a_t}$ would conversely increase. This means that the noise added to the image would increase through timesteps. What it means? Imagine we start from a clean image, and we add noise to it, even a little bit of noise would be noticeable. But if we add noise to a noisy image, the noise added would be insignificant. As a result, with more timesteps, we also need to add more noise to make it be more inflential. This is the logic behind the definition of $a_t$."
